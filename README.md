# SoarCS Project Presentation

By Bryan Montalvan and Athur Rosa


## Technologies Used:
HTML/CSS

## Description:
* This is a website which gives viewers quick information about Lowell with
  * Fun facts
  * Weather
  * Google Maps API

(Unfortunately we couldn't add a free functioning weather api to the site due to time restraints, but enjoy the minimalistic weather widget)
